As you see, your Kubernetes cluster is started. Verify it's ready for your use.

`kubectl version && kubectl cluster-info && kubectl get nodes`{{execute}}

Verify the Kubernetes cluster is empty.

`kubectl get deployments,pods,services`{{execute}}

The [Helm](https://helm.sh/) package manager used for installing applications on Kubernetes is also available.

`helm version`{{execute}}

## Kubernetes Dashboard ##

As an alternative to the kubectl CLI you can also observe and control the cluster activity in the Kubernetes Dashboard. Because the dashboard can be accessed publicly, it is protected and requires the secret access token to login. Because you have administration access to this cluster copy the token from this secret.

`echo -e "\n--- Copy and paste this token for dashboard access ---" && kubectl describe secret $(kubectl get secret | awk '/^dashboard-token-/{print $1}') | awk '$1=="token:"{print $2}' && echo "---"`{{execute}}

Next, by clicking on the _Kubernetes Dashboard_ tab above the command line or from this link: https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-30000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/. At the signin prompt select _Token_ and paste in the key you copied in the previous step.

> With public and production Kubernetes *always* be sure to lock down any kind of Kubernetes administration access including [access to the dashboard](https://www.wired.com/story/cryptojacking-tesla-amazon-cloud/).
