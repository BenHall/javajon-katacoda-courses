This scenario takes you through the basics building deploying and running a MEAN stack on Kubernetes.

These scenarios were inspired from Bitnami's article [Bitnami's article: Deploy A MEAN Application On Kubernetes With Helm](https://docs.bitnami.com/kubernetes/how-to/deploy-mean-application-kubernetes-helm/). That article was inspired from an 2015 article from Ahmed Haque titled [Create a MEAN Stack Google Map App](https://scotch.io/tutorials/making-mean-apps-with-google-maps-part-i)

> MEAN is an opinionated full-stack Javascript framework which simplifies and accelerates web application development. It is a popular choice for developers who want to create web applications with ease. It is based on the NodeJS language and it allows you to write less code with its predefined layout and additional libraries for simplifying the programming of web applications. -Bitnami, _Deploy A MEAN Application On Kubernetes With Helm_
