Helm deploys all the pods, replication controllers and services. The pod will be in a _pending_ state while the container image is downloaded and until a Persistent Volume is available. Once complete it will move into a _running_ state.

Use the _get_ command to find out what was deployed.

`kubectl get deployments,pods,services`{{execute}}

A Redis cluster should now be running on Kubernetes.
