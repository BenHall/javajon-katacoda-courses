Robust messaging for applications to connect and scale.

These next steps provide an ideal place to start deploying and running your first application on Kubernetes. With a Kubernetes cluster based on Minikube and a CLI tool called kubectl, a few steps will get a RabbitMQ running.

You will learn how:

- to use the basics of the kubectl CLI tool
- to install RabbitMQ on Kubernetes
- containers are deployed as Deployments in Pods
- a Service can provide access to a replication of Pods

[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions.
