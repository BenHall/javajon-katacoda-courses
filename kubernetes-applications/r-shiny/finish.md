# Conclusion #

You now understand how to run Shiny applications on Kubernetes.

## Lessons Learned ##

With these scenarios you have learned how:

- to use the basics of the kubectl CLI tool
- to install Shiny applications on Kubernetes
- containers are deployed as Deployments in Pods
- a Service can provide access to a replication of Pods

Use this same technique to create your own containers containing your own Shiny solutions.
