# Kubernetes and Logging #

It's important to remember to treat logs simple as event streams. Containers should only produce logs as event streams and leave the aggregation and routing to other services on Kubernetes. It's so important that it's defined as factor [11 Logs](https://12factor.net/logs) of the [The Twelve Factors App methodology](https://12factor.net/).

One of the best demonstrable solutions has been provided by [Alen Komljen](https://akomljen.com/) in his blog [Get Kubernetes Logs with EFK Stack in 5 Minutes](https://akomljen.com/get-kubernetes-logs-with-efk-stack-in-5-minutes/). This is a helpful short blog, give it a read. The following steps are an adaption of his recommendations in this Katacoda scenario.

As a prerequisite, we assume you have an introductory working knowledge of Minikube covered in the Minikube scenario of this course.

This scenario takes you through the basics of deploying a logging solutions on Kubernetes. The premise is all the log streams generated by the containers are aggregated into a central datastore. From that datastore views can be created to filter logs of interest or event can be fired based on query rules.

This is where the EFK stack kicks in. There are three common solutions for this logging stack:

## Storage: ElasticSearch ##

Elasticsearch is a search engine based on the Lucene library. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents.

## Aggregator: Fluentd ##

[Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/) is an open source data collector, which lets you unify the data collection and consumption for a better use and understanding of data. in this stack Fluentd runs on each node (DaemonSet) and collects all the logs from /var/logs and routes them to ElasticSearch.

This example uses a lighter variation of Fluentd called [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/). Perhaps EfK, with a lower case 'f' would be more apropos. [Alen Komljen](https://akomljen.com/) covers the reason why in his [blog](https://akomljen.com/get-kubernetes-logs-with-efk-stack-in-5-minutes/).

## Viewing: Kibana ##

[Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) is an open source data visualization plugin for Elasticsearch. It provides visualization capabilities on top of the content indexed on an Elasticsearch cluster. Users can create bar, line and scatter plots, or pie charts and maps on top of large volumes of data.

For Kubernetes there are a wide variety of ways to put this stack together, especially with a production or business critical clusters. Some solutions may leverage an ElasticSearch service outside the cluster, perhaps offered by a cloud provider. For any solution that's deployed to Kubernetes its recommended to use Helm charts for defining the solution. Even with Helm charts there are a variety of solutions currently seemly competing with each other.

However, this scenario is aimed to show how you can get a working stack up with reasonable ease so you can see how the components are installed and work with each other.

In the following steps you will learn:

- How to deploy ElasticSearch, Fluent-bit, and Kibana with Helm charts
- How to generate log events and query then in Kibana
