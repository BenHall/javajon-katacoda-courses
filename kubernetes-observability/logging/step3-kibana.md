# Kibana #

Because of Katacoda's virtualization you cannot address this URL from your browser, but you can use Katacoda's domain as the URL to the same service. Notice the same port number placed in the subdomain of the URL.

`https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-31001-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/`{{execute}}

There is also a top above the command line area labeled `Kibana` that takes you to the same Kibana portal.
