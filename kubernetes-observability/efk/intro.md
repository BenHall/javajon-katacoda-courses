# Kubernetes and Logging #

(This is a draft and does not work yet. Pods fail due to out of memory, when memory was set lower, Pods failed for other reasons..., jonathan.johnson@dijure.com)

Containers should only produce logs as event streams and leave the aggregation and routing to other services on Kubernetes. This pattern is emphasized as factor [11 Logs](https://12factor.net/logs) of the [The Twelve Factors App methodology](https://12factor.net/).

A solid demonstrable solution has been provided by [Alen Komljen](https://akomljen.com/) in his blog [Get Kubernetes Logs with EFK Stack in 5 Minutes](https://akomljen.com/get-kubernetes-logs-with-efk-stack-in-5-minutes/). The following steps are an adaption of his recommendations in this Katacoda scenario.

As a prerequisite, we assume you have an introductory working knowledge of Minikube covered in the Minikube scenario of this course.

This scenario takes you through the basics of deploying a logging solution on Kubernetes. The premise is all the log streams generated by the containers are aggregated into a central datastore. From that datastore, queries and filters produce views from the aggregated logs.

Commonly the three components ElasticSearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK) are combined for the stack:

## Aggregation: ElasticSearch ##

Elasticsearch is a search engine based on the Lucene library. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents.

## Forwarding: Fluentd ##

[Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/) is an open source data collector, which lets you unify the data collection and consumption for a better use and understanding of data. in this stack Fluentd runs on each node (DaemonSet) and collects all the logs from /var/logs and routes them to ElasticSearch.

This example uses a lighter variation of Fluentd called [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/). Perhaps EfK, with a lower case 'f' is apropos. [Alen Komljen](https://akomljen.com/) covers the reason why in his [blog](https://akomljen.com/get-kubernetes-logs-with-efk-stack-in-5-minutes/).

Another variation for logging is the E**L**K stack that includes Logstash as a substitution for the Fluent aggregation solution.

## Viewing: Kibana ##

[Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) is an open source data visualization plugin for Elasticsearch. It provides visualization capabilities on top of the content indexed on an Elasticsearch cluster. Users can create bar, line and scatter plots, or pie charts and maps on top of large volumes of data.

For Kubernetes there are a wide variety of ways to assemble EFK together, especially with a production or business critical clusters. Some solutions may leverage an ElasticSearch service outside the cluster, perhaps offered by a cloud provider. For any solution that's deployed to Kubernetes it's recommended to use Helm charts. Even with Helm charts there are a variety of solutions evolving and competing with each other.

However, this scenario is aimed to show how you can get a working stack up with reasonable ease so you can see how the components are installed and work with each other.

In the following steps you will learn:

- How to deploy ElasticSearch, Fluent bit, and Kibana with Helm charts
- How to generate log events and query then in Kibana
