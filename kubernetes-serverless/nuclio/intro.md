[Nuclio](https://www.nuclio.com/) Nuclio is an open source serverless platform which allows developers to focus on building and running auto-scaling applications without worrying about managing servers.

- The fastest platform running up to 400,000 function invocations per second
- Enables simple debugging, regression and a multi-versioned CI/CD pipeline
- Supports a variety of open or cloud-specific event and data sources with common APIs
- Is portable across low-power devices, laptops, on-premises and multi-cloud deployments

You will learn how:

- to install Nuclio on Kubernetes
- functions are deployed and removed
- functions are named, exposed, and invoked
- functions are listed, inspected and monitored

More about the Nuclio architecture is described in the [Nuclio documentation](https://nuclio.io/).
