# Conclusion #

Nuclio is a new "serverless" project, derived from Iguazio's elastic data life-cycle management service for high-performance events and data processing. It is also an emerging serverless solution for Kubernetes.

## Lessons Learned ##

With these scenarios you have learned how:

- to install Nuclio on Kubernetes
- functions are deployed and removed
- functions are named, exposed, and invoked
- functions are listed, inspected and monitored
