# Conclusion #

Kubeless is a Kubernetes-native serverless framework. It runs on top of your Kubernetes cluster and allows you to deploy small unit of code without having to build container images. With Kubeless you can build advanced applications that tie together services using functions.

## Lessons Learned ##

With these scenarios you have learned how:

- to install Kubeless on Kubernetes
- functions are deployed and removed
- functions are named, exposed, and invoked
- functions are listed, inspected and monitored
