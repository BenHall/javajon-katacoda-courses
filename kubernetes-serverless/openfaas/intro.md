[OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com/) is a framework for building serverless functions with Docker and Kubernetes which has first class support for metrics. Any process can be packaged as a function enabling you to consume a range of web events without repetitive boiler-plate coding.

You will learn how:

- to install OpenFaaS on Kubernetes
- functions are deployed and removed
- functions are named, exposed, and invoked
- functions are listed, inspected and monitored

More about the OpenFaaS architecture is described in the [OpenFaaS documentation](https://docs.openfaas.com/).
