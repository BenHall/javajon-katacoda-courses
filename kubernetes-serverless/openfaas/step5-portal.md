# OpenFaaS Portal #

You can also interact with OpenFaaS through its portal. On the right there is a tab called _OpenFaaS Portal_ or from this link: https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-31112-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

When prompted, use the same user name and password that was applied in step 2 with the secret creation. Reveal the password

`echo -e "The OpenFaaS portal will need these credentials when prompted:\nuser: user\npassword: $PASSWORD"`{{execute}}

 For visibility and understanding, leave this tab open for the subsequent steps.
