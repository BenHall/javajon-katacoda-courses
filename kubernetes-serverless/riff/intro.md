![Riff](/javajon/courses/kubernetes-serverless/riff/assets/riff.png "Riff is for functions")

[Riff](https://projectriff.io) The riff CLI helps developers build and run functions using Knative. It includes commands to install Knative in a Kubernetes cluster, and for managing functions, services, channels, and subscriptions.

- Riff is the command line tool, CLI
- Knative (pronounced kay-nay-tiv) extends Kubernetes to provide a set of middleware components that are essential to build modern, source-centric, and container-based applications that can run anywhere: on premises, in the cloud, or even in a third-party data center.
- Istio is a service mesh for Kubernetes
- Kubernetes is the container management system that targets a variety of cloud and data center resources. An operating system for your data center.

You will learn how:

- to install Riff, Knative and Istio on Kubernetes
- to install functions from the CLI interface

More about the Riff, Knative and Istio architecture is described in the [Riff documentation](https://projectriff.io).
