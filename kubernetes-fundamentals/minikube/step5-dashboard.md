# Dashboard #

Another addon that is enabled is the standard Kubernetes dashboard. When running Minikube locally the simple invocation

`minikube dashboard`

is a convenient feature to present the dashboard in your local browser tab. Because of Katacoda virtualization this command will not work, but certainly you can explore the dashboard with this link or click on the _Kubernetes Dashboard_ tab above the command line area.

`export REGISTRY=[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-30000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com`{{execute}}
